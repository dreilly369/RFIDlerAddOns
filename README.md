These are scripts I use to help automate some of the work in capturing RFID signals from Proximity cards. I will add and tweak them as I have time
I will add a short blurb about each tool/script as I add it

## rfidler_capture.py
Used to automatically capture ASKRAW samples into XML files. It adds the bonus of being able to occasionally compress the files to conserve space and 

## rfidler_capture_improved.py
Used to capture a sample of AUTOTAG outputs. Can also be used to create a virtual tag and clone it to a physical tag.
